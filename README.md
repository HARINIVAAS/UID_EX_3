# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

DESCRIPTION:

A Calculator Component in React is a functional component that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a reusable UI element designed to accept user input, process mathematical expressions, and display results. The Calculator Component typically consists of an interactive layout with buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and other control buttons such as clear (C) and equals (=).
Key Features of a Calculator Component:
Display Screen:

Shows the input entered by the user as well as the result of the arithmetic operation. This is where users see the ongoing calculation.
Digit Buttons (0-9):

A grid of buttons representing digits 0 through 9, allowing users to input numbers.
Operator Buttons:

Includes buttons for basic arithmetic operators:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Equal Button (=):

When pressed, it evaluates the expression and shows the result on the display.
Clear Button (C):

Resets the calculator, clearing any current input and results.
Responsive Layout:

The calculator layout is typically responsive, allowing it to adapt to various screen sizes. The buttons are usually laid out in a grid structure for easy accessibility.
Benefits of a Calculator Component:
Reusability: Once the calculator is built, it can be reused in different parts of an application or embedded in other projects.
State Management: React's state management is used to track the input and results. This ensures that the component re-renders efficiently whenever there are changes.
Interactive User Experience: A calculator provides immediate feedback, as users can perform operations and see results in real-time.
